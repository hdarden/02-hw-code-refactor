# Project Description
In this project I cleaned up the semantic tags, exchanging divs for more categorical tags. Tags have been spaced and tabbed so that beginning and ending tags align vertically and it creates visual organization.
The "Search Engine Optimization" link had been fixed so that the page now navigates to that section when navigation <li> is clicked.
The CSS has been cleaned up by grouping like tags with the same styling. 
The accessibility has been updated by adding alt attributes to every <img>.
Heading attributes have been organized in sequential order.
The title name has been changed to give more description and relevance to the webpage.
